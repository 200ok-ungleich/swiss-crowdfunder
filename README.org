**    What does this project do?

Swiss Crowdfunder is a Crowdfunding platform (doh).

This repository is the open source community version of
https://swiss-crowdfunder.com.

**    Why is this project useful?

Crowdfunding using established platforms can be very expensive.
Usually there is a fee of 12-20% that has to be paid.

Swiss Crowdfunder is open source - so it can be used by anyone to
start their own crowdfunding platform or campaign.

**    How do I get started?

*** Setup

**** Install RBenv

macOS: =brew install rbenv=

Official rbenv documentation: https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv.

**** Install Ruby version 2.4.1

macOS: =rbenv install 2.4.1=

**** Install bundler

=gem install bundler=

**** Clone the repository

**** Install dependencies

Within your local checkout run =bundle=.

For testing, install =chromedriver= > v59.

**** Configure Database

Every host that runs this application can have a different database
configuration. There is an example configuration that runs on sqlite,
however that you can easily use by:

=cd config; ln -s database.yml.example database.yml; cd -=

Alternatively you can configure PostgreSQL, MySQL or others.

**** Migrate Database

=rake db:create db:migrate db:seed=

*** Development
**** Start Application

=rails s=

**** Run tests

Automatically run tests while development

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
guard
#+END_SRC

Note for Emacs Users: When using =enh-ruby-mode=, this will also
automatically color your status bar either green on success or red on error.

**** Live Reload

Using the Gems =guard-livereload= and =rack-livereload=, development
and saving of =*.erb= files will reload your browser. Developing
=*.scss= files will also hot-load the respective CSS within the
browser.

*** Deployment

**** Premise

- You need to have the ssh-agent running, for example under Debian =eval
`ssh-agent -s`=.

- Your ssh identities need to be added to the ssh-agent: =ssh-add=


**** Deploy

We are using =capistrano= to deploy the newest version, roll back,
compile assets and restart the app container.

Deploy the newest version of =master=: =cap production deploy=

Optionally you can locally set a local ENV variable =REVISION= to set
a different branch than =master= for deployment.


**** Delete DB in Production

#+BEGIN_SRC

unicorn_wrapper stop
DISABLE_DATABASE_ENVIRONMENT_CHECK=1 rake db:drop db:create db:migrate db:seed

#+END_SRC


**    Where can I get more help, if I need it?

Ping us on info@200ok.ch or info@ungleich.ch or open a Github issue.

** SRE / Maintenance

There is exception notification:

- via email to sre@ungleich.ch
- via mattermost to #crowdfunding-live

** Exception handling process

If I see the email and I am going to work on it, I immediately send a reply
containing "ACK" to let people know that somebody is taking care of it. I
do not say "ACK" if I am not going to work on it. (If it is urgent and
needs to be handled now, I have to work on it right now, otherwise I don't
send an ACK; if it is not urgent, I can send an ACK now and work on it
later if I want to.)

Sending an ACK means that I take ownership of the problem: other people do
not need to worry about it if they see an ACK (unless I ask them for help,
of course).

When investigating, I can, but don't have to send updates.

I must send a short explanation of the problem and the steps I took to
resolve it when I solve it. I should also follow up with steps that have
been taken to prevent this issue in the future.

** Technical Documentation

*** ERD
There is an [[file:doc/erd.dot][ERD]] defined in dot-syntax which is also available as [[file:doc/erd.svg][SVG]].

The command to compile the SVG is: =dot -Tsvg doc/erd.dot > doc/erd.svg=

*** Security

    For the initial version of the application, there is only one route
that can create entities, none that can update or destroy any.
Creation of the resource only works on a valid model and has only the
potential side effect of generating more money for the campaign. Apart
from a brute force attempt of creating bogus data, there's little
security risk involved.

Also, there's no concept of a logged-in user, yet. Therefore, there is
no global lock-down needed/possible. The =cancancan= and =device= gems
are in place, though, for authorization and authentication as soon as
supporters get the ability to create/modify/destroy any other data or
have the ability to log in.

*** Testing on CI

We are using [[https://circleci.com/gh/200ok-ungleich/swiss-crowdfunder][CircleCI]].
